            <h3><em>Mountain Fog, 2018</em></h3>
            <p>
                This piece is 12”x12” and drawn with graphite. To create this, I used a picture I had taken outside of Red Lodge, Montana, and then manually scaled the image up in the drawing. While there are a lot of details in the three trees in the foreground, I tried to keep the background details fairly simple. I also tried to keep the fog on the backmost mountain simple and let it fade into the gray, cloudy sky.

            <h3><em>Balance, 2020</em></h3>
            <p>
                <em>Balance</em> is the first piece I created entirely with charcoal. This abstract piece is 21½” x 15½” and allowed me to get a feel for how graphite worked and felt. I wanted to create a piece that had flow and lots of contrast. To highlight this, I added the curving line in the center with dark bold strokes and framed it with highlight from the eraser. To make the whole piece cohesive I tried to keep most of my shapes round and avoid sharp edges.

            <h3><em>Stars in the Sky, 2020</em></h3>
            <p>
                <em>Stars in the Sky</em> is a 21½” x 15½” piece done entirely in charcoal. To make this piece, I originally made a collage to represent Van Gogh's <em>Starry Night</em>. With the collage, I then manually scaled the size by double and drew the piece. I tried to keep the memorable parts of Starry Night so that the viewer would be able to recognize it even though the aspects are different.
