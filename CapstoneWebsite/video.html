            <p>
                This soundscape, created in Reaper, is made to mimic the sounds one might hear while sitting in a coffee shop. There is gentle, classical music playing with constant chatter happening around the listener. There are scattered keyboard clacks to give the illusion that someone nearby is typing. There is the occasional sounds of coffee being prepared.

            <p>
                <em>Moon Landing</em> was created using various oscillators and delays to give the piece an eerie space ambience. I used the audio from the first moon landing to immerse the listener in the soundscape.

            <h3><em>Song by the River, 2022</em></h3>
            <p>
                This simple song is created by combining MIDI instruments and a nature soundscape. I found working with MIDI instruments to be challenging, and creating soundscapes is a skill I am much more confident in. Consequently, I chose to incorporate both into this piece as a means to get out of my comfort zone and create a calm song with peaceful nature sounds.

            <p>
                This animation was created completely in After Effects and was used in a group project to be a part of a news broadcast. While I had worked in After Effects before, this piece has more complexity than my previous pieces. I wanted it to be eye catching and flashy without being overwhelming. This piece was used in a project for Business Professionals of America where my group competed and placed in the top ten nationally in 2019.

            <p>
                <em>The Cat</em> was created using a technique called rotoscoping. Rotoscoping is a type of animation where the animator draws over each frame of a video. This three second video contains 50 frames.

            <p>
                <em>Milo</em> was created on 4½” x 2½”  pieces of paper and includes 107 individual drawings. This animation follows Milo the fish as he jumps out of the water, splashes back in, and swims away.

            <p>
                <em>The Caster</em>, another rotosope animation, is a video I took of my friend fly fishing and then animated frame by frame. The original video was taken on the Smith River in Montana.

            <h3><em>Maze Man, 2022</em></h3>
            <p>
                This animation was created to be a small trailer for a nonexistent game. I made all the pieces of the animation in Photoshop and then animated it in After Effects. The purpose of this trailer is to draw in the viewer and show them how the game works. I animated the keyboard and keystroke changes to help the viewer understand the movements and the game’s controls.
