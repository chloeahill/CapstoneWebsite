            <p>
                This soundscape is made to mimic the sounds one could hear while sitting in a coffee shop. There is gentle, classical music playing with constant chatter happening around the listener. There are scattered keyboard clacks to give the illusion the listener, or someone nearby is typing. You can also hear the occasional sounds of coffee being prepared.

            <h3><em>Moon Landing, 2022</em></h3>
            <p>
                <em>Moon Landing</em> was created using various oscillators and delays to give the piece the eerie space ambience. Along with the ambience noise, I decided to cut up the iconic phrase to make the listener feel on edge, like something isn’t quite right. While nothing bad happens in this, the listener has the feeling that something bad is about to happen to the people in this soundscape.

            <p>
                This simple song is created by combining MIDI instruments and a nature soundscape. While learning sound design, I found working with MIDI instruments to be one of the harder topics I covered. Conversely, creating soundscapes was a concept I had a much easier time working with. I decided to combine these two concepts and create a calm song that had peaceful nature sounds behind it.

            <p>
                This animation was created completely in After Effects and was used in a group project to be a part of a news broadcast. While working in After Effects before, this was my first piece to have depth and multiple moving parts. I wanted to have lots of things to catch the viewer's eye while still creating a cohesive image. This piece was used in a project for BPA (Business Professionals of America) where my group competed and ended up placing in the top ten nationally in 2019.

            <h3><em>The Cat, 2022</em></h3>
            <p>
                This is a simple rotoscope animation that outlines a cat moving. This was my first introduction to working with rotoscoping. The style of this animation is very simple with a lot of movement in the lines. The video of the cat itself is fairly simple and I wanted to create something more for the audience to look at by making the lines have a jittery feel to them.

            <h3><em>Milo, 2022</em></h3>
            <p>
                This animation was created on 4½” x 2½”  pieces of paper and includes 107 of individual drawings. Milo follows a little fish as he jumps out of the water and swims away. I wanted this animation to seem fairly simple and also have lots of moving parts. Along with this, I decided to have the title drop into the water and pop into bubbles to tie more into the rest of the piece.

            <h3><em>The Caster, 2022</em></h3>
            <p>
                The Caster shows the video of a person fly fishing with an outline around them and on the rod. This video is one I took and I used rotoscoping to achieve the outline over it. I wanted to highlight the rod and make the fishing line more visible to the viewer. To make it feel like the rod wasn’t out of place, I also outlined the person to keep the piece cohesive.

            <p>
                This animation was created to be a small trailer for a nonexistent game. To create it, I made all the pieces of the animation in Photoshop and then animated it in After Effects. The overall animation and design is fairly simple, yet it’s fast paced to keep the viewer interested. I also added the keyboard and keystroke changes to help the viewer understand the movements and the game’s controls.
