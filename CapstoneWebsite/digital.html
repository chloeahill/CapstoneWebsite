                <p>
 	                <em>Twelve Designs</em> exhibits images that use only circles and squares in black and white to show a one word meaning. There are four different words with three pieces for each one. Each piece is its own artwork. These designs were helpful in getting me out of my comfort zone and showing the importance of each piece of the artwork, no matter how small the detail is.

                <h3><em>Self Portrait, 2021</em></h3>
                <p>
                    As titled, this piece is a self portrait I made of myself in Photoshop. I wanted to explore making this piece with only shapes that had a solid fill. This process helped me see the different values and shapes in many pieces and allowed me to get out of my comfort zone. To juxtapose the sharp edges of the portrait, I placed a swirling texture in the background that also helped bring out the blue shades on my face.

                    This poster was not made for a specific purpose or event, but rather for practice. I focused on using different fonts, and sticking to a color palette. I wanted to make sure this piece was eye-catching, but not too overwhelming to disrupt from the information on the poster.

                <p>
                    <em>Mountain Night</em> was made in Photoshop using loose shapes that came together to form the mountain and other scenery. The trees and moose were brushes I made and customized to give the appearance I wanted. I chose to keep the entire palette different shades of blue to keep the nighttime atmosphere and make the image feel calm and still.

                <p>
                    This illustration is made in Illustrator and depicts a simplified portrait of my back. It was one of the first pieces I made in this program and while it has some minor flaws, it overall is very clean and precise. I wanted to keep the composition simple and chose to do a solid color as the background that shows slight light and shadows. I also chose purple for the background to help make the hair color stand out.

                <p>
                    <em>Bee Visible</em> is a logo I created for a made up business to practice logo design. In this piece I put the logo in several different formats with general information on the logo available. As for the logo itself, I chose to have the color palette to just two colors that are similar to keep the design simple yet eye catching.

                    Arcanum, meaning secrets or mysteries, is a logo I created using Illustrator. This piece depicts a snake poised under the word encompassed in a circle. I created all aspects of this logo including the font. I also used this piece to push my comfort zone in regards to color. I used bright vivid colors and only stuck to three.

                <h3><em>Treasure State Reeds, 2023</em></h3>
                <p>
                    I created these logos for a small business named Treasure State Reeds. The owner of this business wanted a logo that encompassed Montana while being bold and eye-catching. I tried to incorporate as many iconic Montana qualities without it being overwhelming. Instead of doing a more natural color palette for this piece, I chose to use deep reds with a light blue to make the piece more dynamic and to make the words pop more for the viewer.
