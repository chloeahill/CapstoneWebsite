                <p>
 	                <em>Twelve Designs</em> exhibits images that use only circles and squares in black and white to show a one word meaning. There are four different words with three designs for each word. Each of the twelve designs is its own piece. These designs were helpful in pushing me out of my comfort zone because my usual style is less abstract.

                <p>
                    As titled, this piece is a self portrait I made in Photoshop. I wanted to create a piece using shapes with a solid fill. My favorite part of this piece is how well you can see the different shades of color that are normally blended together. 
                    To juxtapose the sharp edges of the portrait, I placed a swirling texture in the background that also helped bring out the blue shades on my face.

                <p>
                    This poster was not made for a real event, but rather for practice. I focused on using different fonts, and sticking to a color palette. I wanted to make sure this piece was eye-catching, but not too overwhelming to disrupt from the information on the poster.

                <p>
                    <em>Mountain Night</em> was made in Photoshop using various tones of blue to create a calm and quiet nighttime atmosphere.
                    The trees and moose were brushes I made and customized to easily place them throughout the piece.

                    This illustration is made in Illustrator and depicts a simplified portrait of my back. I wanted to keep the composition simple and chose to do a solid color as the background that shows slight light and shadows. I also chose purple for the background to help the hair color stand out.

                <p>
                    <em>Bee Visible</em> is a logo I created for a made up business to practice logo design. I created several variations of the logo to simulate different ways it could be used. I chose to keep the color palette limited to just two colors to keep the design simple and recognizable.

                    The word Arcanum means secrets or mysteries, is a logo I created using Illustrator. This piece depicts a snake poised under the word encompassed in a circle. I created all aspects of this logo including the font.

                <h3><em>Treasure State Reeds, 2023</em></h3>
                <p>
                    I created this logo for a small business named Treasure State Reeds. The owner of this business wanted a logo that encompassed Montana while being bold and eye-catching. The owner of Treasure State Reeds wanted to incorporate Montana qualities so I chose to create a mountain landscape. Instead of using an earthy color palette, I used deep reds with a light blue to make the piece more dynamic and to make the words pop.
